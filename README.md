**🧠About Neuro🧠**

Neuro is an AI Chatbot that utilizes a Neural Network and Natural Language Processing to read in human speech and output a message dependant on what it predicts the message is saying. Neuro has many functionalities alongside simple conversation. It can solve math equations, check the weather and check stock prices and trends through API calls, tell jokes, tell quotes, tell time, recommend music, define words, and can play Rock Paper Scissors!.

**💡Inspiration💡**
I wanted an excuse to learn about PyTorch and Neural Networks. This project was able to solve that for me. Along with Neural Networks, I was also able to learn about Tensors and Natural Langauge Processing.

**📝Learning📝**
This Project not only helped me in teaching me about PyTorch, Neural Networks, and Natural Langauge Processing, but it also helped me solidify my Python knowledge, JSON knowledge, and API calls. This project also allowed me to utilize other built in python libraries 
like re and random, libraries I hadn't used in a while.
